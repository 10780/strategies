Look for any word or phrase
Work in silence
Look at you hand and count down from five, say an idea
Use physical tools
Must include X
No editing
Ask your body
Increase one item, reduce another
Consider mistakes as alternate intentions
Reuse an old idea
Consider branch points in the evolution of what you have

Describe an idea in one sentence, go from there
Create with the fewest possible parts
Collaborate, alternate contributing elements
